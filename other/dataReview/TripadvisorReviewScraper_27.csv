Đồ ăn: 5","Fantastic gastronomic experience","We were passing through HCMC and decided it was a great opportunity to experience a world famous Kobe beef steak. On arrival we were escorted to our room and allocated a dedicated server who took our order. We opted for a Kobe set menu and a Foie Gras set menu. In the UK this would be called a fine dining tasting menu Our allocated chef appeared and set up to prepare the meal on the hot plate in front of us.
The Foie Gras menu included courses of prawns, scallops, salmon, foie gras and Australian rib eye. See photos. The skill and hand speed of our chef was phenomenal as she cooked and prepared the various courses. The Kobe was melt in the mouth special. The textures, flavours and presentation of all the dishes are up there with some Michelin starred restaurants I have visited.
Sitting at a table with a chef preparing food at the table may not suit anyone looking for a quiet intimate experience. But we found it to be a fantastic gastronomic experience. Fabulous.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/23/5e/2b/5e/kobe-restaurant.jpg

Einen Stern Abzug da das Restaurant auf die Preise am Ende nochmal 10% Steuer UND NOCHMAL 10% ""Service Charge"" aufschlagen. Das bringt am Ende einen Faden Beigeschmack. Zu Zweit waren wir so bei 174 Euro, aber einem netten Abend und LECKEREM Essen.

Nhà hàng nằm trong một biệt thự thuộc địa xinh đẹp, nơi có thêm bầu không khí tuyệt vời. Các cửa sổ mở ra và không khí vào buổi tối thật tuyệt.
Thức ăn ngon, nhưng với điều kiện chúng ta đang ở Việt Nam, quốc gia nơi hải sản tươi sống ở khắp mọi nơi, thức ăn trong kobe không có gì nổi bật, nhưng là món ăn ngon của teppanyaki.","1","","COUPLES","2018-04-30","2018-05-18","2018-05-18","vi","Kobe Teppanyaki Restaurant","3542854","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d3542854-r580990514-Kobe_Teppanyaki_Restaurant-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

방문 시 제법 오래된 식당의 포스와  직원들의 응대가 괜찮다고 생각했다.
직원의 도움을 받으며 주문을 하게 되었는데 일본에서 오늘 도착한 조개라면서 추천한 메뉴가 나와 있는 사진과 실물은 차이가 너무  많이 나는 걸 같이 간 일행과 공감하면서 이건 아니지 하면서 식사를 하였다.
전반적인 서비스 품질은 우수한 편이나 역시 식당은 음식 맛으로 승부를 해야하는데 이점은 다소 미흡한 것 같다.
입맛이 까다로운 사람들은 평가를 저조하게 할 것 같고 그냥 조용한 방에서 큰 부담없이 식사를 하기에는 나쁘진 않은 것 같다.","0","","BUSINESS","2017-12-31","2018-01-07","2018-01-07","ko","Kobe Teppanyaki Restaurant","3542854","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d3542854-r552232773-Kobe_Teppanyaki_Restaurant-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

Chúng tôi đặt bàn lúc 8: 15 và chờ 25 phút để ngồi, 30 phút nữa cho món ăn đầu tiên của chúng tôi được phục vụ. Các nhân viên tiếp tục chạy vào và ra mà không nói bất cứ điều gì cho đến khi tôi phàn nàn rằng chúng tôi đã chờ đợi một thời gian rồi, họ chỉ nói xin lỗi vì họ quá bận rộn và thế thôi, thậm chí không nói với tôi khi thức ăn có thể sẵn sàng.
