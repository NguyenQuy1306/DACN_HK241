I usually order similar dishes when going to different restaurants to see their take on the dish.

This is by far the best Vietnamese restaurant that I have been to here in Vietnam. They serve food which is fit to be found in a resort situation.

We ordered the bun thit nuong, char siu with egg and fried rice, ca phe sua da, tra da and mango smoothie.

The char siu was juicy unlike the usual type that you would get at other Asian restaurants. The mango smoothie was definitely fresh with small pieces of sweet mango that added to its rich texture.

The man at the front was so friendly and always had a smile on his face when dealing with customers.

If you are visiting Vietnam, then this is a restaurant that you should not miss!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/86/d4/8f/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-29","2024-02-28","en","Nha Hang Asian Kitchen","1122081","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d1122081-r940158131-Nha_Hang_Asian_Kitchen-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"
