The meals chosen suited our different tastes and were really tasty, well presented and great. we enjoyed superb coconut cream coffee - must be tried!

Vị trí của họ là trên
 Tầng 5 nên chúng tôi đi qua một nhà hàng khác. Vô cùng đói khát và không thể chờ đợi lâu hơn nữa, chúng tôi đã yêu cầu 1 starer chia sẻ và 2 nguồn chính cho mỗi cái. Tin tôi đi món salad mực nướng thật tuyệt vời. Tôi có thể cảm thấy vị chua, ngọt, một chút cay trong món ăn đó. Con mực rất tươi như thể chúng vừa đánh bắt từ biển. Không chỉ là stater ngon mà còn có 2 món chính là tuyệt vời. Tôi đã thử món cá sông mekong và con gái tôi đã nướng tôm với sốt tiêu đen. Con cá hoàn toàn không xương. Tôi đã rất ấn tượng bởi mùi sả chiên giòn. Cá philê bên ngoài giòn và bên trong ngon ngọt. Để tôm, họ ướp với nước sốt tự làm. Nó có thể bao gồm tỏi, hạt tiêu đen và một ít bột mì. Nước sốt đặc quánh như sữa đặc. Thưởng thức với cơm trắng nóng là sự kết hợp hoàn hảo. OMG tôi không yêu cầu thêm. Các mocktails là tuyệt vời, tôi đã nghiện. Sau khi chúng tôi kết thúc, người quản lý đã cho chúng tôi một số địa điểm để đến Sài Gòn, giúp chúng tôi o đối xử với bạn, khiến bạn cảm thấy như đang ở nhà. Cảm ơn bạn đã chào đón nồng nhiệt.

As a starter, I had the most delicious prawns with a fiery dipping sauce, but not so fiery that it blew away the sweetness and freshness of the seafood.
For my main course, I had difficulty choosing, but eventually decided on river fish with a green chilli sauce.  It looked quite beautiful, but greed overcame everything and I forgot to take a photograph. The fish was perfectly cooked, and came with a salad of green mango and carrot, rice and spiced corn. So far, so fabulous. But then there was the green chilli sauce, a perfect balance of sweet, sour and heat. Amazing! I'm not sitting on the fence here.

With its good reviews we decided to go to the fifth floor of the building to try food even though there is another restaurant downstairs. Everything in this place was good. It's a small venue with nice decorations. The food was well prepared and delicious.  I got the beef rolls in the piper leaf which was really tasty. The waitress taught me how to eat it by using their noodles bundle to roll every and deep in the homemade fishsauce. Just like the way to eat Vietnamese pancakes, using some herbs to make the flavour stronger. When we finished our meal, the waiter came and gave us some recommendations and tips in Saigon. What a nice experience!","4","","NONE","2020-02-29","2020-02-25","2020-02-25","en","Parsley - Steak, Pasta and More","18679854","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d18679854-r747647115-Parsley_Steak_Pasta_and_More-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

The food is excellent with a great selection and fabulous quality and presentation
We had prawns and beef and the tastes were sublime accompanied by a passion fruit mojito and a bottle of red wine
Best of all was the service. We were looked after by Chilli who have us advice on what to order. On leaving he gave us a list of places to visit and a good luck message.
A great start to our visit to HC M city","6","","NONE","2020-02-29","2020-02-24","2020-02-24","en","Parsley - Steak, Pasta and More","18679854","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d18679854-r747421955-Parsley_Steak_Pasta_and_More-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

The waiter (Long) came to explain the menu and he asked about our allergies. My partner couldn't eat nuts and they kindly separate peanuts on the side for me so that we could share the dishes. We had three courses which was fit for two and the price was cheap as the portion was big.
I had a passionfruit mojito and it was great. Thank you for such a lovely evening!","2","","NONE","2020-02-29","2020-02-23","2020-02-23","en","Parsley - Steak, Pasta and More","18679854","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d18679854-r746900689-Parsley_Steak_Pasta_and_More-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"
