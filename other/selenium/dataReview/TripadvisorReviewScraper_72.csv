Thankful that it weren't crowded - so the kids were able to roam around a little.
The live band and singer helped spruce up the mood and our little ones loved it.
The pretty and glittery bar aside, the tapas that we ordered were all fun and different from most other restaurants, even other Spanish tapas restaurants, and that sense of intrigue at the arrival of each dish just made the entire dining experience more fun. The servers were also quick to help us at every turn and to explain each dish to us.
The restaurant also served us some free dessert for Vietnamese Women's Day.

Good experience overall.

Il est accessible par un étroit escalier qui donne sur une grande et jolie salle bien climatisée et décorée aux couleurs de l'Espagne dominante rouge. Même la musique y est, présente mais discrète. L'ambiance est agréable, les serveurs souriants même s'ils ont besoin d'être sollicités. La carte est alléchante avec la plupart des assiettes en photos. C'est bien présenté, commenté par le serveur et les saveurs sont fines mais quelques unes sont vraiment minuscules, à l'image des calamars frits dont la portion minuscule ne vaut pas être partagée. Sa photo ne figure d'ailleurs pas sur la carte.
Pour le même prix nous aurions aimé un peu plus copieux.

Most items are pretty authentic Spanish Tapas.

It was rare to find Angus beef tartar on a set lunch starters menu in HCMC but it's available here. Their ""Pisto Manchego"" was a simple, but probably unique twist of egg on toast with the addition of the Manchego (sheep) cheese.

Our mains of ""Canelones"" and ""Tortilla abierta de morcilla y chorizo"" were comforting and tasty, though they also felt like starters, as they had few slices of chorizo and sausage on an egg, kinda like half a portion of an American breakfast. Then again, quality VS quantity? You decide. The Catalan-style creme brulee was pretty normal. 

Would recommend this place for comforting Spanish Tapas flavours.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/f1/c4/5e/tomatito-sexy-tapas-bar.jpg

This restaurant probably thrived as a tourist spot. A lot of thought and effort has been taken to create a ambience conducive to promote customer satisfaction but it failed. One would think that lighting is essential to a good restaurant rather then be a hindrance. But the lighting fails to do a basic function. That is to allow the customer to actually read the menu unless you leave your table and find enough light in some other part of the restaurant.The lighting is so low that you need a torch to read a menu. Then there is the background music that is so loud that neither my wife or myself could not have a comfortable conversation. To make matters worse the staff could not hear our orders properly. You would think that that would be enough for the staff to lower the volume. No we had to ask for the volume to turned down so we could here each other. Trying to find a beer that they had in stock became a total choir. Then to top it off one of our meals was forgotten. All in all it was not a good experience. Simple things that make a dining experience memorable were badly managed.","3","","COUPLES","2021-01-31","2021-01-11","2021-01-11","en","Tomatito - Sexy Tapas Bar","13388070","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d13388070-r780965431-Tomatito_Sexy_Tapas_Bar-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

And Tomatito has crafted one of the best brunch menus around. Trust me, I’ve been nursing this delicious food baby all afternoon.

To start we had both the Sopa de Guisantes con Jamon, a beautiful green pea soup mixed with mint, courgette and Iberian ham, and the Croquetas de Espinacas, 3 spinach infused goat cheese croquettes. Clearly we were off to a good start! 

Next up we devoured the Huevos Manchegos, a piping hot skillet of crispy papas fritas topped with a colourful vegetable piperade, manchego shavings and a perfect pair of sunny side up eggs. We also sunk our teeth into the Huevos Rotos con Chorizo, which was a combination of deliciously seasoned scrambled eggs and savoury Spanish Chorizo.

For our mains, first we indulged in the Canelones. A Spanish classic of gorgeous braised beef and truffle cannelloni, garnished with sautéed mushrooms. Delicious, delectable and delightful all wrapped up and smothered in queso! Then when we tried out the Pata de Pulpo. Barbequed, tender grilled octopus accompanied by smoked potato puree, creamy aioli and crispy potatoes. Yum!

Finally for dessert, Tomatito’s Chocotrufta y Palomitas de Maíz should be at the top of everyone’s dessert bucket list. A velvety dark chocolate brownie, caramelized truffle popcorn, fluffy mascarpone mousse and rich creamy ice cream. I mean just close your eyes and let the drool flow.

Tomatito’s refreshed brunch menu combined with their classic Spanish bites we all know and love make this spot a must on any foodie’s list when in Saigon. We all know the importance of starting your weekend off on the right foot and that means brunching to your best ability. So, grab your extra-large glass of sangria and sip away those Sunday scaries!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1b/19/87/79/sangria.jpg

Chỉ cần đặt toàn bộ menu. Mỗi một người đều tốt. Đánh giá này là dành cho Julio khi anh ấy vẫn còn là một đầu bếp ở đây, tôi tin rằng anh ấy đã chuyển sang nhà hàng khác.
Không khí: môi trường tốt cho một nhóm bạn hoặc đêm hẹn hò.
Đồ uống: đắt tiền và không ấn tượng lắm nhưng dù sao chúng tôi cũng đến đây để kiếm thức ăn.","0","","NONE","2019-10-31","2020-01-30","2020-01-30","vi","Tomatito - Sexy Tapas Bar","13388070","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d13388070-r742105860-Tomatito_Sexy_Tapas_Bar-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"
