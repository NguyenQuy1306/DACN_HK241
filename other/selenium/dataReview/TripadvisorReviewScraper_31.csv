We asked for, and they gave us, an in depth history of Vietnam, its language and places to visit ( and not visit at this time of year) in Vietnam as well as suggestions if we ever visit again. Lovely ambience and background speakeasy vibe. Fab selection of whiskeys and cocktails and a wide selection of good wines- (they do happy hours for 50% but check the times ) and non alcoholic drinks also available. Hidden away down the back of an alley nearish the Saigon centre,  ( with staff outside and along the alley to guide us - it was perfectly safe anyway) we found this hidden treasure. Food menu looks excellent though we came late to the bar so did not eat. Barman has excellent English and one of the bar girls, though a little shy, soon got chatting. There is live music on Friday and Saturday early evening too! What a little jewel to find! Tad more expensive than local bars as mostly imported but the choice and quality on offer was good.","0","","COUPLES","2023-07-31","2023-07-17","2023-07-17","en","Nhà Hàng The Alley Cocktail Bar & Kitchen","11885108","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d11885108-r903731798-The_Alley_Cocktail_Bar_Kitchen_Restaurant-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

The bar is a bit difficult to find tho. Walk along Pasteur street and behind the Vera massage there is a small alley that you have to follow until the end, past the old compass.

One of the few bars where the bartenders can prepare a decent Sazerac right off the bat. Pretty small and intimate, and great fun once the band comes on. The only problem is losing track of how much you’ve drunk...

Great cocktail bar, and one I would revisit in a heartbeat whenever I’m back in Saigon.","2","","NONE","2019-10-31","2019-11-05","2019-11-04","en","Nhà Hàng The Alley Cocktail Bar & Kitchen","11885108","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d11885108-r723936141-The_Alley_Cocktail_Bar_Kitchen_Restaurant-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

Lost at the main street but finally I found this hidden gem. Quiet noisy and busy bar but the music was so good. especially the blind pianist took my heart. His playing is outstanding. I enjoyed the music a lot and would like to visit again. The waiter can speak English very fluently and was friendly. Appreciated with his help :) The drink he recommended was perfect.","1","","NONE","2019-10-31","2019-10-06","2019-10-06","en","Nhà Hàng The Alley Cocktail Bar & Kitchen","11885108","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d11885108-r715746089-The_Alley_Cocktail_Bar_Kitchen_Restaurant-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"
