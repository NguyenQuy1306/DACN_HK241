Although the food was quite good the service leaves a lot to be desired. We were seated at the back of the resto near the kitchen in view of a succession of dirty dishes despite there being other empty tables. Our food took quite a while to arrive but was tasty & copious. Instead of the (relatively) sophisticated dining experience I had anticipated, however, staff were chatting loudly all around us. Perhaps it’s a cultural thing in VN but not what I expected from this low light linen napkin “high end” restaurant. When we stopped eating our plates & left-over food was whisked away without the server even asking if we were done or if we wanted to perhaps take the left overs home. As it was, we were finished but again, it’s another example of poor staff training. Despite the food being tasty I wouldn’t rush back to Tandoor.","1","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-07-11","2024-07-11","en","Tandoor","1122944","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d1122944-r959012307-Tandoor-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

So we ordered food from Tandoor. 

The food was horrible and not even palatable. Dal makhni was uncooked. Chole was uncooked too. Paneer was colored . The food was too garlicky. I dnt know how these Indian restaurants r surviving on account of bad food ! 

I called them as I wanted to enquire something bfore ordering so they suggested me to order directly and not from GRAB. So that’s the reason I couldn’t put review on GRAB. So here it is … 

Please don’t order from this place… BAD food ! If you are Indian , you would know the quality of food !! WORST.

First of all the service is terrible they were literally forcing us to eat fast and get out of the restaurant because they wanted to close the kitchen. And when we couldn't eat more the waiter was very rude and kept telling us to eat the leftovers. Moreover, the food itself is horrible. It lacks lots of taste and the rice were sticky.

Heerlijke gerechten smaakvol geserveerd. Het personeel is erg vriendelijk. De verse fruitsappen zo lekker. De akoestiek echter laat veel te wensen over. Er zijn geen geluiddempende materialen gebruikt.","0","","FRIENDS","2023-09-30","2023-09-23","2023-09-23","nl","Tandoor","1122944","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d1122944-r918093706-Tandoor-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

Only catering to bus loads.
All oily sauce with no meat.
Service was terrible and management couldn't care less.
Glass of wine says 150mls. But not even 100mls.
Don't waste your time.","0","","COUPLES","2023-08-31","2023-08-27","2023-08-27","en","Tandoor","1122944","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d1122944-r913234255-Tandoor-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"
