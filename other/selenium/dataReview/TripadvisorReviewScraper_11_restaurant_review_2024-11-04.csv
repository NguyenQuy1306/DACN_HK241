As soon as you step off the elevator, you’re greeted by a warm ambiance that blends tropical charm with modern design.

The rooftop setting is truly magical, especially during sunset when the city lights begin to twinkle. The seating is comfortable, with a mix of cozy lounges and dining tables, making it suitable for both intimate dinners and lively gatherings. The decor is colorful and fun, enhancing the overall experience.

The menu is a tantalizing mix of tropical-inspired dishes and classic favorites. The standout items include their signature Banana Mama Burger, which is juicy and flavorful, and the refreshing Mango Salad, perfectly dressed with a zesty vinaigrette. For drink enthusiasts, the cocktail menu does not disappoint; the Banana Mojito is a must-try, striking a perfect balance between sweetness and refreshing mint.

Banana Mama Rooftop & Kitchen is a fantastic destination for those looking to enjoy delicious food with a view. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or just unwinding after a long day, this rooftop gem is worth a visit. Just be sure to make a reservation, as it can get busy, especially on weekends!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2d/ae/3e/cd/caption.jpg
