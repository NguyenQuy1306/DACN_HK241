Đồ ăn: 3","Just a Regular Burger Joint","We came one evening for the special deals but in fact the prices were so good on the menu that we ended up ordering what ever we fancied from the menu. Although I had come to try the beef burgers I was tempted by the Cajun chicken burger instead as I love spicy Cajun flavours and one friend had the regular chicken burger and fries. Our other friend had a cheese burger with coleslaw and French fries. The service honestly wasn't very good throughout. I arrived first so I ordered a drink. When it arrived the waitress put it the furthest point away on the table , well out of arm's reach, although she could easily have walked to where I was sitting at the table. However, I soon forgot about that as it was minor. However, later I asked if it was possible to have the coleslaw without the ginger if I ordered coleslaw. She pleasantly said she would check with the chef. 20 minutes later I asked her if she had had a chance to speak to the chef and she said that yes it was possible to prepare a coleslaw without the ginger and that she had forgotten to come back and tell me. When our food arrived, one of my friend's French fries had been forgotten, even though our order had been previously read back to us. They finally arrived a lot later, as the waitress asked the chef to cook them after we had received our burgers. She also tried to clear them away 10 minutes later when there were still half left in the container. We had to assume that she couldn't see that they weren't finished from the angle she was standing at. I ordered a second drink that didn't arrive either. After about 15 minutes I asked about the drink and the waitress said she hadn't realised that I had asked for another one when I put in the request earlier.  Apart from these hiccoughs the staff were friendly and appeared to be willing to help. I also appreciated the flexibility about making a coleslaw according to a customer's request. My friend said her regular burger was fine, as were her fries and our other friend also said her fries were good. However her beefburger was very rare, though in fairness she hadn't thought to ask for it to be medium-well done. As she was pressed for time she decided not to ask for it to be cooked a bit longer but she took it away as a take away to eat later at home. I must admit that I was disappointed with my Cajun burger. It tasted like a regular breaded chicken burger with hardly any spices at all. Salt and pepper helped to give it more flavour and there were some delicious sauces on the table which I added to it  which did help matters. I make a lot of Cajun chicken, as well as eat it in restaurants a lot, so I guess I was expecting the chicken underneath the breadcrumbs to have been marinaded and flavored with Cajun spices, or mixed in with the breadcrumbs at the very least. I think I would definitely like to go again but I would try a beefburger rather than a chicken burger, especially as there were so many tempting toppings on the menu. Friends who are fans of Soul Burger have persuaded me to give it another try but to try completely different burgers. Finally, the coleslaw too was bland and rather disappointing - the grated cabbage was virtually dry, no dressing and hardly discernable mayonnaise. So, next time I think ditch the coleslaw, order French fries and try one of the beef burgers with some delicious sounding toppings.","0","","NONE","2021-02-28","2021-02-24","2021-02-24","en","Soul Burger","7783233","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d7783233-r783510783-Soul_Burger-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

One shocked customer chose to leave the premises while I was there.
This ""restaurant"" does not offer parking, so they relegate that task to some local thugs.
While I was there, I had to go down 3 times to stop them from mishandling my property. One of them managed to steal my keys and kept them  hostage for 20 minutes. Only After 25 minutes of searching and threatening with police did they give it back.
If you want to lose your keys, your bike or your mind, or are up for a fight, do go to Soul Burger, they are sure to show you a bad time and ruin your day.
The 3 waitresses that worked there were kind and professional, and just as apalled as we were to their manager wrong doings.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1b/91/c5/52/soul-burger.jpg

French fries were fried perfectly, the garlic dip was wonderful and so were the drinks.

Finding this place can be difficult as you have to walk into a small corridor and up a floor.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/4c/fc/71/photo0jpg.jpg

ベトナムの物価から考えても金額はそこそこ高いと思いますが、ボリューミーで味もしっかりとしているハンバーガーをここでは味わう事ができます。肉の焼き加減も自分でチョイスできます。この時はミディアムでいただきました。","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/20/1a/4a/caption.jpg","NONE","2019-08-31","2019-09-04","2019-09-04","ja","Soul Burger","7783233","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d7783233-r706617713-Soul_Burger-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"
