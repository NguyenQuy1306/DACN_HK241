I found the inside a little dated and smelt of cigars from the cigar club. Which was weird because all the shopping on the ground floor is designer labels, but the hotel part was old and dated. The rooftop is such a great spot to enjoy a drink and the view, however its Sydney prices. 
Overall I was disappointed with the service and found that some of the front desk people were not very accommodating.","0","","FAMILY","2024-03-31","2024-04-02","2024-04-01","en","Rex Hotel","3162821","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d3162821-r944893850-Rex_Hotel-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

On vous change de chambre mais la chambre donne sur une cours intérieure où les camions viennent décharger..... 

Ils ont quand même offert des biscuits et chocolats pour s’excuser!

Ensuite si bar sur le toit, impossible de se faire service par le personnel ! 2 tentatives: 1x servit mais après 30 minutes et l’autre reçu la carte après 15 minutes sur demande et ensuite plus rien .....

Le comble, à la fin, on me demande si j’ai pas pris une lavette et veulent contrôler ma valise!

But keep in mind there are more modern, high rise, ""nicer"" hotels nearby.  What the other hotels lack is the history, boutique feel, amazing staff, but they do have newer facilities.  For example, our room had beautiful wood floors and furniture but an old worn-out sofa and curtains, our daughter's room had a leak somewhere that was slightly buckling the floor and made the room smell moldy.

Breakfast is superb, there are live shows in the hotel, as well as luxury shopping, several rooftop pools, access to private drivers and guides, etc.  But if you prefer modern, functional luxury to old world luxury, you might be happier elsewhere.","1","","NONE","2019-11-30","2019-11-05","2019-11-05","en","Rex Hotel","3162821","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d3162821-r724189615-Rex_Hotel-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

チェックインの対応をしてくださった女性の方が、とても感じがよく素敵な方で、滞在中ロビーで見かけてはいつもにっこりお辞儀して見送ってくれました。はじめてのホーチミンと、レックスホテルにとてもいい印象を受けました。
レックスホテルを選んで大正解でした。
そして、特典が沢山ありました。
ルーフトップバーのドリンク1杯無料券、エグゼクティブラウンジ使用、一部屋１日2枚までのクリーニング無料、15:00までレイトチェックアウト無料。中でも一番嬉しかったのは、バースデーケーキを用意してくれたこと、チェックアウト前日に、ベッドによく眠れるようにと童話のコピーとチョコレートを添えて置いてくれていたことです。
素敵な心遣いがとても嬉しかったです。
チェックインした当日が私の誕生日だったことに気づいたレセプションの女性の方が、こちらから何も申し出ていないのに、”バースデーケーキをお部屋へお持ちします”と手配してくれました。
いただいたケーキのプレートには名前と誕生日がデコレーションされてあり、感動しました！もちろん、ケーキも美味しかったです。
ありがとうございました！！
エグゼクティブラウンジは、ティータイムに利用しましたが、空いていました。
ドリンクや、フルーツなどいただきました。
また、レセプションで水上人形劇のチケットを半額(宿泊者割引)で購入し、ホテル内で拝見しました。
劇場まで外出しなくても同じクオリティでホテルで楽しめるなんて、とても素晴らしいサービスです。
はじめての水上人形劇のパフォーマンスの高さにも圧倒され、楽しませて頂きました。
人形劇の後はルーフトップバーで生演奏を聴きながら軽食をとりましたが、美味しかったです。
こちらでもスタッフの方の対応がとても良かったです。
朝ごはんは、とても種類が多く、噂通りフォーが美味しかった。バインコットも焼きたてでとても美味しくて大満足。毎日お腹いっぱい食べてました。
立地が良いので観光して買い物してはホテルへ荷物を置きにいっては休息したりと、本当によくホテルを活用したので、滞在中は一日中満喫しました。
次回また宿泊したいホテルですが、ひとつだけ困ったことがありました。
スタンディングシャワーブースの扉の隙間から水が漏れてきてしまうので、トイレの床までびちゃちゃになってしまいました。以外は全て水圧もよく、お湯も熱くて申し分なくゆったりできました。

レックスホテルで素敵な休暇を過ごせてとても楽しかったです。
ホーチミンへ来た際はまた利用させていただきますね。
本当にありがとうございました。","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/d7/dd/ea/rex-hotel.jpg

Only go for the view at this bar if you must. This place purports to be high end. However, have low expectations of drinks and service. My wife thought she would have a treat of a small bottle of champagne. It came, plastic cork, flat and warm. When we complained, it was not responded to well. We were begrudgingly offered a glass of wine instead. It came, small and even warmer. Had to add ice to it and then it was so watery. I ordered a gin and tonic. 25 minutes later, the gin came with a tin of tonic. With around eight staff and not many more customers, what took so long!!!!
The food menu was uninspiring so we didn’t bother. 
We were then charged for the champagne, even though we sent it back. We were told it was to keep the accounts straight. That was a very expensive small Glass of warm, watery wine. 
The view is good but go somewhere else instead. It is the only place we have had bad service in Vietnam. ","3","","COUPLES","2019-08-31","2019-08-23","2019-08-22","en","Rex Hotel","3162821","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d3162821-r702046432-Rex_Hotel-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

5階にルーフトップバーがありますが、オシャレ度には欠けます。でも、夜景もgood、美味しいカクテルを色々作ってくれますよ。

In the lobby in the lobby restaurant. Hallways, elevators. It stinks in there and would be gross if I had brought my family. 

Have left my luggage to be held twice. Both times they were incredibly rude. One time I think ok strange but twice, they are just rude and act like this is a huge inconvenience. 

Asked for help at front desk, also rude and annoyed I asked.","3","","BUSINESS","2019-04-30","2019-07-26","2019-07-26","en","Rex Hotel","3162821","https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/ShowUserReviews-g293925-d3162821-r692871262-Rex_Hotel-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"

As a regular guest this was the last time I stayed in the Rex hotel. Over priced no service. 
the breakfast ad usual is not up to standard eg coffee is burned, where Vietnam is proud of there coffee
Than there was no commentary water bottles in the room, as a result getting charged for mini bar, is like calling in the middle of the night for commentary toilet paper. 
A sspecial thank you to
